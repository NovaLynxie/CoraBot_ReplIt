# THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED! 
As of commit 5906c88 (v2.8.0), any new features have been migrated into CoraBot's main repository and further development has moved there.
Please check https://github.com/NovaLynxie/CoraBot_Main for future bot updates.

# CoraBot_ReplIt
_**UPDATE! CoraBot now has its music functionality back as repl.it now supports music bot functionality!**_  
A modified version of CoraBot's code for use with Replit. ~~This version does not have music functionality due to replit limitations.~~


# About Cora
 Hi there! My name is Cora. I am NovaLynxie's personal discord bot built using discord.js on nodejs.
 A while back, I was made as a small test bot to help run experimental features and help them as a discord bot for their guild.
 Now, I am much more stable compared to my early days of running experimental code and testing the limits of what I could achieve.
 My main purpose is to help you bring some life to your discord guild or community server, wherever I can.
 I can play some music for you, give you information about me or help you moderate your own guild using my own custom built admin commands!
 Don't worry, I also come with a help command so you can find out what commands I have, just ask whenever you're having trouble remembering one of my commands.
